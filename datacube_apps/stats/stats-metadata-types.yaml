    Mosaic datasets.

    Datasets with spatial but not temporal extent.

    Similar in structure to datasets products by eodatasets.

dataset:
    # Where to find certain fields in dataset objects:

    # UUID: Unique for this exact dataset. Reprocessed datasets have new UUIDs.
    id: ['id']

    # datetime the dataset was processed/created.
    # This is used to know which is the latest dataset (when multiple versions exist).
    creation_dt: ['creation_dt']

    # The dataset "label" is the logical identifier for a dataset.
    #
    # -> Multiple datasets may arrive with the same label, but only the 'latest' will be returned by default
    #    in searches.
    #
    # Use case: reprocessing a dataset.
    # -> When reprocessing a dataset, the new dataset should be produced with the same label as the old one.
    # -> Because you probably don't want both datasets returned from typical searches. (they are the same data)
    # -> When ingested, this reprocessed dataset will be the only one visible to typical searchers.
    # -> But the old dataset will still exist in the database for provenance & historical record.
    #       -> Existing higher-level/derived datasets will still link to the old dataset they were processed
    #          from, even if it's not the latest.
    #
    # An example label used by GA (called "dataset_ids" on historical systems):
    #      -> Eg. "LS7_ETM_SYS_P31_GALPGS01-002_114_73_20050107"
    #
    # But the collection owner can use any string to label their datasets.
    label: ['ga_label']

    # Where to find a dict of measurements/bands in the dataset.
    #  -> Dict key is measurement/band id,
    #  -> Dict value is object with fields depending on the storage driver.
    #     (such as path to band file, offset within file etc.)
    measurements: ['image', 'bands']

    # Where to find a grid spatial information, like CRS and image bounds
    grid_spatial: ['grid_spatial', 'projection']

    # Where to find data format (GeoTiff, NetCDF, etc)
    format: ['format', 'name']

    # Where to find a dict of embedded source datasets
    #  -> The dict is of form: classifier->source_dataset_doc
    #  -> 'classifier' is how to classify/identify the relationship (usually the type of source it was eg. 'nbar').
    #      An arbitrary string, but you should be consistent between datasets (to query relationships).
    sources: ['lineage', 'source_datasets']

    # Fields that we want indexed and searchable in the documents.
    # (the keys/names are arbitrary, but are specified by users when searching)
    search_fields:
        # When no 'type' is specified, it defaults to String.
