Australian Geoscience Data Cube
===============================

The Australian Geoscience Data Cube provides an integrated gridded data
analysis environment for decades of analysis ready earth observation satellite
and  related data from multiple satellite and other acquisition systems.

In 2014, Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the NCI established the Australian
Geoscience Data Cube, building on  earlier work of Geoscience Australia and
expanding it to include additional earth observation satellite and other
gridded data collections (e.g. MODIS, DEM) in order to expand the range of
integrated data analysis capabilities that were available. The complete
software stack and petabytes of EO are deployed at the NCI petascale computing
facility for use by NCI users.
