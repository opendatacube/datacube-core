  title: Pixel Quality 25 v2
  summary: |
    The PQ25 product facilitates interpretation and processing of Surface Reflectance (SR-N/NT),  Fractional Cover 25 (FC25) 
    and derivative products.

    PQ25 is an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation
    of the Earth surface and also whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. The PQ product allows 
    users to produce masks which can be used to exclude pixels which do not meet their quality criteria from analysis . 
    The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for emerging multi-temporal analysis techniques that
    make use of every quality assured pixel within a time series of observations.\nUsers can choose to process only land pixels,
    or only sea pixels depending on their analytical requirements, leading to enhanced computationally efficient.

    PQ provides  an assessment of the quality of observations at a pixel level and includes information about:
    -	Spectral Contiguity (lack of signal in any band)
    -	Saturation in any band
    -	Presence of cloud
    -	Presence of cloud shadow
    -	Land or sea

    As Landsat Imagery becomes more readily available, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of analyses undertaken
    by researchers around the globe.  Most researchers use some form of quality masking schema in order to remove undesirable
    pixels from analysis, whether that be cloud, cloud shadow, observations over the ocean, or  saturated pixels.  In the past, 
    researchers would reject partly cloud-affected scenes in favour of cloud-free scenes.  However, Landsat time series analysis
    using all cloud-free pixels has become a valuable technique and has increased the demand for automation of cloud, cloud 
    shadow and saturation detection.  Emergency response applications such as flood mapping typically have to contend with
    individual cloud affected scenes and therefore rely on effective cloud and cloud shadow removal techniques.

    The PQ25 product combines established algorithms that detect clouds including the Automated Cloud Cover Assessment 
    (ACCA) (Irish et al. 2006) and Function of mask (Fmask) (Zhu and Woodcock 2012) . ACCA is already widely used within the 
    remote sensing community; it is fast and relatively accurate.  Fmask on the other hand is newer, but is rapidly becoming 
    more established, and can provide a more accurate cloud mask than ACCA in certain cloud environments.

    The sensor saturation flagging protocols developed for the Web Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) product as described 
    in Roy et al. (2011) are used to flag sensor saturation.\nThe PQ25 product has similarities to the QAB layer packaged
    with OLI data, however it uses additional algorithms to detect cloud and cloud shadow, and is available for Landsat 5, 7 and 8.

  history: |
    -	Ground Control Points (GCP): new GCP chips released by USGS in Dec 2015 are used for re-processing
    -	Geometric QA: each product undergoes geometric assessment and the assessment result will be recorded within v2 AGDC for filtering/masking purposes.
    -	Processing parameter settings: the minimum number of GCPs for Ortho-rectified product generation has been reduced from 30 to 10.
    -	DEM: 1 second SRTM DSM is used for Ortho-rectification.
    -	Updated Calibration Parameter File (CPF): the latest/current CPF is used for processing.
