  title: Surface Reflectance NBAR+T 25 v2
  summary: |
    Surface Reflectance (SR) is a suite of Earth Observation (EO) products from GA. The SR product suite provides standardised optical surface reflectance datasets using robust 
    physical models to correct for variations in image radiance values due to atmospheric properties, and sun and sensor geometry. The resulting stack of surface reflectance
    grids are consistent over space and time which is instrumental in identifying and quantifying environmental change. SR is based on radiance data from the Landsat TM/ETM+
    and OLI sensors.

    The standardised SR data products deliver calibrated optical surface reflectance data across land and coastal fringes. SR is a medium resolution (~25 m) grid based on the 
    Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI archive and presents surface reflectance data in 25 square metre grid cells.

    Radiance measurements from EO sensors do not directly quantify the surface reflectance of the Earth. Such measurements are modified by variations in atmospheric 
    properties, sun position, sensor view angle, surface slope and surface aspect. To obtain consistent and comparable measures of Earth surface reflectance from EO,
    these variations need to be reduced or removed from the radiance measurements (Li et al., 2010). This is especially important when comparing imagery acquired in 
    different seasons and geographic regions.

    The SR product is created using a physics-based coupled BRDF and atmospheric correction model that can be applied to both flat and inclined surfaces (Li et al., 2012). 
    The resulting surface reflectance values are comparable both within individual images and between images acquired at different times and/or with different sensors.
    Terrain affects optical satellite images through both irradiance and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. Slopes facing the sun receive enhanced
    solar irradiance and appear brighter compared to those facing away from the sun. For anisotropic surfaces, the radiance received at the satellite sensor from a sloping 
    surface is also affected by surface BRDF which varies with combinations of surface landcover types, sun, and satellite geometry (sun and sensor view, and their relative 
    azimuth angle) as well as topographic geometry (primarily slope and aspect angles). Consequently, to obtain comparable surface reflectance from satellite images covering 
    mountainous areas, it is necessary to process the images to reduce or remove the topographic effect so that the images can be used for different purposes on the same 
    spectral base. A Digital Surface Model (DSM) resolution appropriate to the scale of the resolution of satellite image is needed for the best results. 1 second SRTM DSM is 
    used for NBART processing.

    Landsat Archive

    GA has acquired Landsat imagery over Australia since 1979, including  TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery. While this data has been used extensively for numerous
    land and coastal mapping studies, its utility for accurate monitoring of environmental resources has been limited by the processing methods that have been traditionally 
    used to correct for inherent geometric and radiometric distortions in EO imagery. To improve access to Australia s archive of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data, several 
    collaborative projects have been undertaken in conjunction with industry, government and academic partners. These projects have enabled implementation of a 
    more integrated approach to image data correction that incorporates normalising models to account for atmospheric effects, BRDF and topographic shading (Li et al., 2012).
    The approach has been applied to Landsat TM/ETM+ and OLI imagery to create the SR products. The advanced supercomputing facilities provided by the National 
    Computational Infrastructure (NCI) at the Australian National University (ANU) have been instrumental in handling the considerable data volumes and processing 
    complexities involved with production of this product.

    Surface Reflectance Correction Models

    Image radiance values recorded by passive EO sensors are a composite of
    - 	surface reflectance;
    -	atmospheric condition;
    -	interaction between surface land cover, solar radiation and sensor view angle; 
    -	land surface orientation relative to the imaging sensor.
    
    It has been traditionally assumed that Landsat imagery display negligible variation in sun and sensor view angles, however these can vary significantly both within 
    and between scenes, especially in different seasons and geographic regions (Li et al., 2012). The SR product delivers modeled surface reflectance from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI
    data using physical rather than empirical models. Accordingly, this product will ensure that reflective value differences between imagery acquired at different times by 
    different sensors will be primarily due to on-ground changes in biophysical parameters rather than artifacts of the imaging environment.

    Integrated Time Series Data

    Once consistent and comparable measures of surface reflectance have been retrieved from EO data, it is possible to quantify changes 
    in Earth surface features through time.

    Given the growing time series of EO imagery, this landmark facility will streamline the process of reliably monitoring long-term  chnges in land and water resources.

  history: |
    -	Ground Control Points (GCP): new GCP chips released by USGS in Dec 2015 are used for re-processing
    -	Geometric QA: each product undergoes geometric assessment and the assessment result will be recorded within v2 AGDC for filtering/masking purposes.
    -	Processing parameter settings: the minimum number of GCPs for Ortho-rectified product generation has been reduced from 30 to 10.
    -	DEM: 1 second SRTM DSM is used for Ortho-rectification.
    -	Updated Calibration Parameter File (CPF): the latest/current CPF is used for processing.
